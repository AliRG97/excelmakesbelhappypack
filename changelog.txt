changed 4/20/2020:
	re-order state edict list from most frequently used to least frequently used
	removed centralization edict
	added a decision to disable all your edicts (requires a month to pass and another click to re-enable)
	NDefines.NAI.ADVISOR_BUDGET_FRACTION = 0.2
		reduced from NDefines.NAI.ADVISOR_BUDGET_FRACTION = 0.3
		trying to increase AI net income ratio
	NDefines.NAI.CANCEL_CONSTRUCTION_SIEGE_PROGRESS = 101
		from NDefines.NAI.CANCEL_CONSTRUCTION_SIEGE_PROGRESS = 0
		buildings don't get destroyed when sieged, not sure why AI cancels constructions at all
		*not sure if this will work.  101% siege chance *might* mean that even in non fort provinces they won't cancel buildings (which have a 100% chance).  
	NDefines.NAI.DESIRED_SURPLUS = 0.15
		from NDefines.NAI.DESIRED_SURPLUS = 0.10
	NDefines.NAI.BIGSHIP_FRACTION = 0.3
		from NDefines.NAI.BIGSHIP_FRACTION = 0.4
	tweaked some AI_will_do logic on buildings
		workshops / marketplaces / courthouses
	
	
		
changed 4/19/2020:
	PEACE_ALLY_WARSCORE_MULT from 0.5 to 1.0
		the tweaks to AI desire for peace seem to work well for warleaders, but makes allies drop out of 'won' wars too easily. this should hopefully fix that.
	nerfed development ideas dev event
		mean_time_to_happen = {years = 50}
			(was: {years = 30})
		playtesting revealed too high of 'monarch point' generation effect at 30 years.
		*this event will likely see frequent balance changes
	introduced scaling MTTH multiplier to development ideas events
		local dev cost and global dev cost reductions increase frequency
		local dev cost and global dev cost penalties decrease frequency
	added combat width from technology cheat sheet to the army template interface
	colonial nations are now hard coded to take expansion 1st.
	
		
changed 4/18/2020:
	removed restriction on tier 2 and 3 naval buildings	
		(they used to be mutually exclusive)
	biased the AI toward taking dip dev when using development ideas
		~25%adm/50%dip/25%mil
	removed 10% manpower idea from Expansion ideas
		replaced (buffed) with +1 colonist
			this should help colonial nation AI
			also increases total colonist count in game, which is fine imo.
	reversed order of ideas 1 and 2 on Exploration ideas
		allows for direct exploration immediately after idea #1
	added a 66% boost to development frequency in provinces that have an active colonist
		buffs using your colonist in your own *FULLY CORED STATE* land
	NDefines.NAI.PEACE_TIME_MONTHS = 36
		buffed from 30
		adds 6 months of 'length of war' enthusiasm
	NDefines.NEconomy.MAX_BUILDING_SLOTS = 14 
		from 12, apparently a problem with building restrictions in super high dev provinces (too many building types)
	tweaked interface popup locations
	disabled the empowered government reforms popup at game start
		now only accessible from decision to show government reforms
	

		
changed 4/17/2020:
	nerfed courthouse (government) buildings
		25/50/75/100 state maintenence -> 20/40/60/80
		60/120/180/240 cost -> 75/150/225/300
	nerfed manpower edict
		500/750/1000/1250 manpower -> 250/500/750/1000
		25%/50%/75%/100% manpower multiplier unchanged
	buffed tradepower edict
		50/60/70/80% tradepower multiplier unchanged
		+1.0/+1.5/+2.0/+2.5 raw tradepower added
	nerfed all sources of republican tradition gain from 1.0 to 0.3 ratio
		(matches strengthen government effect for legitimacy)
	fixed development ideas auto-tally mechanic
		(see decisions for tally, only appears when you have development idea #1)
	nerfed development idea event frequency
		20 year mtth -> 30 year mtth
	buffed AI
		less stupid with trade power edict (always turns it off in favor of defensiveness if being sieged)
	yearly legitimacy from royal marriages
		0.1 -> 0.2
	nerfed prestige decay
		5% -> 6%
	nerfed army tradition decay
		5% -> 6%	
	nerfed naval tradition decay
		5% -> 6%
