changed 4/26/2020:
	development
		local_development_cost scaled modifier added back at 0.015
		local_development_cost scaled modifier removed
			tested it at 0.01 and 0.02, overall felt too strong
		overall this is still a buff to development costs, which will be factored into other changes
changed 4/25/2020:
	organized static modifiers changes into individual groups, similar to defines changes
	development
		local_development_cost scaled modifier of 0.03 removed
			this was the feature that made dev cost go up by:
				3% per dev between 10-19
				6% per dev between 20-29
				9% per dev between 30-39 etc			
		local_development_cost scaled modifier added at 0.01
			this means DEVELOPMENT = PENALTY
				e.g. 25 dev = 25% local dev cost penalty
				e.g. 35 dev = 35% local dev cost penalty
		overall this is a buff to development costs, which will be factored into other changes
	building cost
		local_build_cost = 0.03 added
			this is scaled by development
			e.g. 10 development province: buildings will cost 10 * 0.03 = 30% more
			e.g. 25 development province: buildings will cost 25 * 0.03 = 75% more
	autonomy
		local_autonomy
			added -0.1 local_autonomy
				e.g. at 100% autonomy, autonomy now comes down by 0.10
				e.g. at 50% autonomy, autonomy now comes down by 0.05
	unrest
		local_autonomy = 0.01
			e.g. 5 local unrest increases autonomy by 0.05
			e.g. 15 local unrest increases autonomy by 0.15
	num_of_provinces
		global_autonomy = 0.001
			e.g. own 30 provinces, global monthly autonomy == 0.030/mo
			e.g. own 75 provinces, global monthly autonomy == 0.075/mo
			
changed 4/24/2020:
	updated a policy to triggered modifiers to show more policies
		nationalism+quantity
	removed localization nonsense at top of possibly policies tooltip to show more policy pairs
	made policy tooltips interface ~5.4% better by fixing color problems
	
changed 4/23/2020:
	NDefines.NAI.ADVISOR_BUDGET_FRACTION = 0.10
		WAS NDefines.NAI.ADVISOR_BUDGET_FRACTION = 0.20
		still too expensive. they suck at using monarch points anyway, why waste money on advisors and then waste monarch points
	reverted NDefines.NAI.DESIRED_SURPLUS = 0.15
		back to vanilla NDefines.NAI.DESIRED_SURPLUS = 0.10
		possibly causing AI to mothball forts more often, which is bad.

	fixed the development ideas events from accidentally firing 3x as intended

	fixed some typos in the localization files...
	changed increased dev cost modifier to start at 51 instead of 50
	NDefines.NAI.MAX_CAV_PERCENTAGE = 100
		WAS NDefines.NAI.MAX_CAV_PERCENTAGE = 50
		AI now use cav betterer when they have huge cav to infantry ratio
	NDefines.NAI.MIN_CAV_PERCENTAGE = 0
		WAS NDefines.NAI.MIN_CAV_PERCENTAGE = 5
		poor AI now use no cav better.
	centers of trade
		reverted change from idea variation mod
			was 25/50% local tax modifier
			NOW  -10% state dev cost (vanilla)
	NDefines.NMilitary.FORT_FLIPPING_TIME = 60
		WAS NDefines.NMilitary.FORT_FLIPPING_TIME = 30
		having an army unsiege a province should logically be superior to a fort magically unsieging a province

changed 4/22/2020:
	dhimmi estate
		fixed that you could convert provinces held by dhimmi while they were 'content'
		(40-60% loyalty)
	removed stupid little green medals from missions interface because they are stupid.
	organized all defines changes into groups for easier tracking and compatibility		
	Nationalist estate cooldown on "Offer Positions" interaction "nerfed" to 20 years.
		this syncs up the timer with the "Demand Support" interaction, much like all other estates.
	Professionalism
		0% =  +20% looting speed
			WAS 0%
		20% = +0% looting speed
			WAS -16%
		40% = -20% looting speed
			WAS -32%
		60% = -40% looting speed
			WAS -48%
		80% = -60% looting speed
			WAS -64%
		100% = -80% looting speed
			WAS -80%

	NDefines.NEconomy.BANKRUPTCY_PROVINCE_DEVASTATION_GAIN = 10
		Was - NDefines.NEconomy.BANKRUPTCY_PROVINCE_DEVASTATION_GAIN = 5
		this wasn't intended to be included in the pack.  Reverting to original value.
	NDefines.NMilitary.FORT_DEVASTATION_IMPACT = -10
		WAS - NDefines.NMilitary.FORT_DEVASTATION_IMPACT = -5
		also wasn't intended to be included in the pack.  Reverting to original value.
	Condottieri contracts:
		was 4 month warn, 10 month tattle tale, 12 month minimum contract
		now 5 month warn, 11 month tattle tale, 12 month minimum contract
		
changed 4/21/2020:
	same color cb..is now a thing!
		if you border someone with a country color that is too similar to yours, you both get a cb against each other.  where by borders at?
	Professionalism now has a decay rate of 3%
		e.g 100% professionalism, you lose 3% per year
		e.g 15% professionalism, you lose 0.45% per year
	High Professionalism results in less looting
		e.g. -80% looting speed at 100% professionalism
		e.g. -12% looting speed at 15% professionalism
	removed development decision from development ideas
		(the group is going in a different direction from the original concept, this decision is deprecated)
	added AI get ideas on release/creation
		uses standard logic for choosing groups, NOT history files (yay!)
	added army drill base decay back to game
	army drill now gives different effects
		WAS
			discipline = 0.10
		NOW
			discipline = 0.05
			land_morale = 0.05
			land_attrition = -0.1
			cav_to_inf_ratio = 1
			cavalry_flanking = 1
		some of these effects are for testing purposes and might not even work.
	fixed horde ideas availability for the correct countries
	quality ideas was changed by bel
		scaling age bonuses to fire/shock etc instead of flat modifiers


changed 4/20/2020:
	re-order state edict list from most frequently used to least frequently used
	removed centralization edict
	added a decision to disable all your edicts (requires a month to pass and another click to re-enable)
	NDefines.NAI.ADVISOR_BUDGET_FRACTION = 0.2
		reduced from NDefines.NAI.ADVISOR_BUDGET_FRACTION = 0.3
		trying to increase AI net income ratio
	NDefines.NAI.CANCEL_CONSTRUCTION_SIEGE_PROGRESS = 101
		from NDefines.NAI.CANCEL_CONSTRUCTION_SIEGE_PROGRESS = 0
		buildings don't get destroyed when sieged, not sure why AI cancels constructions at all
		*not sure if this will work.  101% siege chance *might* mean that even in non fort provinces they won't cancel buildings (which have a 100% chance).  
	NDefines.NAI.DESIRED_SURPLUS = 0.15
		from NDefines.NAI.DESIRED_SURPLUS = 0.10
	NDefines.NAI.BIGSHIP_FRACTION = 0.3
		from NDefines.NAI.BIGSHIP_FRACTION = 0.4
	tweaked some AI_will_do logic on buildings
		workshops / marketplaces / courthouses
	
	
		
changed 4/19/2020:
	PEACE_ALLY_WARSCORE_MULT from 0.5 to 1.0
		the tweaks to AI desire for peace seem to work well for warleaders, but makes allies drop out of 'won' wars too easily. this should hopefully fix that.
	nerfed development ideas dev event
		mean_time_to_happen = {years = 50}
			(was: {years = 30})
		playtesting revealed too high of 'monarch point' generation effect at 30 years.
		*this event will likely see frequent balance changes
	introduced scaling MTTH multiplier to development ideas events
		local dev cost and global dev cost reductions increase frequency
		local dev cost and global dev cost penalties decrease frequency
	added combat width from technology cheat sheet to the army template interface
	colonial nations are now hard coded to take expansion 1st.
		
changed 4/18/2020:
	removed restriction on tier 2 and 3 naval buildings	
		(they used to be mutually exclusive)
	biased the AI toward taking dip dev when using development ideas
		~25%adm/50%dip/25%mil
	removed 10% manpower idea from Expansion ideas
		replaced (buffed) with +1 colonist
			this should help colonial nation AI
			also increases total colonist count in game, which is fine imo.
	reversed order of ideas 1 and 2 on Exploration ideas
		allows for direct exploration immediately after idea #1
	added a 66% boost to development frequency in provinces that have an active colonist
		buffs using your colonist in your own *FULLY CORED STATE* land
	NDefines.NAI.PEACE_TIME_MONTHS = 36
		buffed from 30
		adds 6 months of 'length of war' enthusiasm
	NDefines.NEconomy.MAX_BUILDING_SLOTS = 14 
		from 12, apparently a problem with building restrictions in super high dev provinces (too many building types)
	tweaked interface popup locations
	disabled the empowered government reforms popup at game start
		now only accessible from decision to show government reforms
	

		
changed 4/17/2020:
	nerfed courthouse (government) buildings
		25/50/75/100 state maintenence -> 20/40/60/80

		500/750/1000/1250 manpower -> 250/500/750/1000
		25%/50%/75%/100% manpower multiplier unchanged
	buffed tradepower edict
		50/60/70/80% tradepower multiplier unchanged
		+1.0/+1.5/+2.0/+2.5 raw tradepower added
	nerfed all sources of republican tradition gain from 1.0 to 0.3 ratio
		(matches strengthen government effect for legitimacy)
	fixed development ideas auto-tally mechanic
		(see decisions for tally, only appears when you have development idea #1)
	nerfed development idea event frequency
		20 year mtth -> 30 year mtth
	buffed AI
		less stupid with trade power edict (always turns it off in favor of defensiveness if being sieged)
	yearly legitimacy from royal marriages
		0.1 -> 0.2
	nerfed prestige decay
		5% -> 6%
	nerfed army tradition decay
		5% -> 6%
