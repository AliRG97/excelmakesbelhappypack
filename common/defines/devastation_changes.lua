NDefines.NMilitary.FORT_DEVASTATION_IMPACT = -5				-- IDP changed from -10 to -5. Devastation was removed way too quickly in BT as you can literally spam forts everywhere anyway. Especially considering random lv 1 forts even in the endgame can be used to remove the devastation.
NDefines.NEconomy.BANKRUPTCY_PROVINCE_DEVASTATION_GAIN = 5		-- IDP changed from 10 to 5. Bankruptcy caused too much bullshit devastation spirals for nations.
