flavor_daimyo.16.d:3 "Some time back one of our retainers, Asano Naganori, was forced to commit Sudoku after attacking a rival, Kira Yoshinaka, within the walls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Breaching the peace of our capital is a serious offense and few thought much more would come of it.\nYesterday, however, it seems forty seven sworn men, former Samurai of the dead Asano, now leaderless Ronin, breached Kira's mansion. Fighting their way through his defenders they finally avenged their fallen master, killing Kira and taking his head with them to Asanos grave.\nWhile a great feat there can be no doubt that these men have broken the laws of our [Root.GovernmentName] and that they deserve to be imprisoned and executed. And yet the people seem to admire and idolize these men."
